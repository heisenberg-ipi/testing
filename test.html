        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in lukewarm water and let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.</li>
            <li>Add half of the flour to the bowl and mix until combined. Add the salt and olive oil, then gradually add the remaining flour until a soft dough forms.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover, and let it rise for 2 hours or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature (usually 475-500°F/250-260°C).</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Form each piece into a ball and let rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stretch or roll one dough ball into a 12-inch circle.</li>
            <li>Spread crushed tomatoes over the dough, leaving a small border around the edge.</li>
            <li>Add mozzarella pieces evenly across the pizza.</li>
            <li>Bake for 8-10 minutes until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
            <li>Top with olive oil and fresh basil leaves.</li>
