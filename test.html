            Getting a flat tire is frustrating, but changing it yourself is easier than you might think. With proper preparation and technique, you can be back on the road in just 15 minutes. Here's how to do it safely and efficiently.
        </p>
        
        <h3>What You'll Need:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Spare tire</li>
            <li>Car jack</li>
            <li>Lug wrench</li>
            <li>Wheel wedges (or bricks/large rocks in a pinch)</li>
            <li>Flashlight (if dark)</li>
            <li>Gloves (optional but recommended)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="step">
            <p><span class="step-number">Step 1: Find Safe Ground</span><br>
            Pull completely off the road onto flat, solid ground. Turn on your hazard lights, apply the parking brake, and place wheel wedges on the opposite side of the flat tire.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <p><span class="step-number">Step 2: Prepare Your Tools</span><br>
            Remove the spare tire, jack, and lug wrench from your trunk. If your vehicle has a hubcap, remove it to access the lug nuts.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <p><span class="step-number">Step 3: Loosen the Lug Nuts</span><br>
            Use the lug wrench to turn each lug nut counterclockwise about one turn. Do this while the tire is still on the ground. Don't remove them completely yet.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <p><span class="step-number">Step 4: Position the Jack</span><br>
            Place the jack under the frame near the flat tire. Look for a designated jack point in your owner's manual. Raise the vehicle until the tire is about 6 inches off the ground.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <p><span class="step-number">Step 5: Remove Lug Nuts and Tire</span><br>
            Completely remove the lug nuts (keep them in a safe place) and pull the flat tire straight toward you to remove it. Set it aside.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <p><span class="step-number">Step 6: Mount the Spare Tire</span><br>
            Align the spare tire with the wheel bolts and push it all the way onto the wheel hub. Hand-tighten all lug nuts.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <p><span class="step-number">Step 7: Lower and Tighten</span><br>
            Lower the vehicle until the tire touches the ground but still bears no weight. Tighten the lug nuts in a star pattern. Then completely lower the vehicle and give each nut a final tightening.</p>

            <h3>Quick Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Check your spare tire's pressure monthly</li>
                <li>Never crawl under a vehicle supported only by a jack</li>
                <li>Have your flat tire repaired or replaced as soon as possible</li>
                <li>Most spare tires aren't designed for high speeds or long distances</li>
            </ul>
